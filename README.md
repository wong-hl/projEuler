Decomposed large exponent into multiplication of smaller exponents, used bit shift to find 2^n, acyclic convolution, decomposed multiplication into addition and properties of sum of digits |
|       66       |     Diophantine Equation    |   Yes   | Well, I still needed to solve all equations less than 1000? So, Yes?| Originally intended to determine if there was a way to know the periodicity of sqrt(d) as a continued fraction to determine the length. This would be an indication of which convergent value corresponds to the fundamental solution. However, I am unable to find a reliable method in literature. I thought it might be related to if d is congruent to modulo 4?|
