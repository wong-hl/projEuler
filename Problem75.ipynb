    "1. A property of the sum of pythagorean triplets is that it will always be even. This automatically eliminates half of all possible values. \n",
    "2. From one primitive pythagorean triplet, I can find all sums that are a multiple of it. If a number is a multiple of more than one sum, then it will have more than one solution. For example, $120 = 30 \\times 4 = 12 \\times 10 = 40 \\times 3$. Therefore, from the first $x$ number of primitives, I can eliminate most sums.\n",
    "3. I can terminate when every even number less than $1500000$ can be expressed as a multiple of my primitives. I don't think I need to go all the way to $1500000$. \n",

    "<h2> How does this method work? </h2> \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Find all the primitive Pythagorean Triplets with a total perimeter of less than $L$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Get the perimeters of all of the primitive triplets. Since the perimeters will always be even, divide all by 2 to reduce the space complexity of the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Using the known primitive triplets, find all the multiple of it below $L$. Increment the counter associated with that value by 1. This method is very inefficient in terms of space/memory requirements as it requires a vector of size $L/2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Count the number of entries in the vector that have a counter value of $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**General comments of this method:**\n",
    "1. It is slow. I think computationally, it can be made more efficient by a) removing the clone of the hashmap that contains all triplets (this was put in place as the hashmap was borrowed mutably and immutably in the same scope) b) using a ternary tree instead of the structs? I did this was I wanted to see if I can find a way around it c) matrix vector multiplication could also result in improvements but I wanted to do try to do this without an external crate. However, this seems to be causing quite a bit of overhead\n",
    "2. The counting of the number of unique perimeters takes up *a lot* of space. I've used a similar concept to the seive of erosthenes to \"count up\" numbers that have multiples. But, it will *always* require a vector of size $L/2$. Perhaps, there is an alternative that has a lower space complexity but I got lazy at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is step 1 found?**\n",
    "1. Euclid's formula allows the terms of the triplet ($x$, $y$, $z$) to two variables $m$ and $n$. \n",
    "2. A condition of $m$ and $n$ is that they must be coprime and be of opposite parity. Given that all coprime integers lie on three branches and selecting the starting value to be $(2,1)$, this allows for all $m$ and $n$ values to be found. Therefore, their $gcd$ never need to be found or tested if they are are of opposite parity.\n",
    "3. Using this method also guarantees that $m$ and $n$ will always increase. Hence, once the upper bound is exceeded, then the algorithm can safely terminate.\n",
    "4. Once the maximum perimeter is exceeded, a branch is deemed to have \"died\" such that it is unable to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What property does step 3 use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Euclid's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Generating_a_triple), it is known that all non-primitve triplets can be found using, \n",
